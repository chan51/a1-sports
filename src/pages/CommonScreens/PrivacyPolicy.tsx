          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach
          stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
          United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites
          collecting personally identifiable information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
          exactly the information being collected and those individuals with
          whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
